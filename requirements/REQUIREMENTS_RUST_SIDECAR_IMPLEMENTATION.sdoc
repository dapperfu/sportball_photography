[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-001
TITLE: Python Bindings Save Method
STATEMENT: The ImageSidecar Python bindings SHALL expose a save_data() method that accepts (image_path: str, operation_type: Union[str, OperationType], data: Dict[str, Any]) and returns bool indicating success.
RATIONALE: The sportball Python code expects this API. Current implementation has create_sidecar() but sportball expects save_data() signature.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-002
TITLE: Python Bindings Read Method
STATEMENT: The ImageSidecar Python bindings SHALL expose a read_data() method that accepts (image_path: str) and returns Optional[Dict[str, Any]] containing the sidecar data. This method SHALL support reading both JSON (.json) and binary (.bin) sidecar file formats automatically based on file extension.
RATIONALE: Sportball requires reading existing sidecar files to extract detected faces/objects. Currently image-sidecar-rust has no read capability, causing broken extraction workflows. Read operations MUST use Rust exclusively per TR-008.3.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-003
TITLE: Multi-Operation Sidecar Support
STATEMENT: The read_data() method SHALL return all operations stored in a sidecar file, including face_detection, yolov8, and other operations, in a single dict structure. The save_data() method SHALL merge new data with existing operations rather than overwriting.
RATIONALE: Sportball stores multiple detection operations (face_detection, yolov8) in single sidecar files. Save operations must preserve existing operations when adding new ones.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-004
TITLE: Binary Format as Default
STATEMENT: ALL sidecar file operations SHALL default to binary format (.bin) using bincode serialization. JSON format SHALL NOT be the default or used as fallback. If Python code requests sidecar operations, they SHALL be stored in binary format exclusively.
RATIONALE: Binary format provides 50-70% size reduction and 3-10x faster performance. JSON fallbacks create inferior solutions and are prohibited per requirements.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-005
TITLE: No Python Fallback Logic
STATEMENT: The Rust sidecar implementation SHALL NOT support or allow any "fallback" to Python serialization. If Rust is unavailable or fails, the error SHALL be raised to Python layer - NOT silently handled or worked around. Python is prohibited from manipulating sidecar files directly.
RATIONALE: Requirements explicitly state "There SHALL be NO manipulation, editing, appending, etc. within Python code" and "If Rust is inadequate, the Rust project SHALL be fixed".
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-006
TITLE: Sidecar File Extension
STATEMENT: Sidecar files SHALL use .bin extension. The ImageSidecar binding SHALL save to image_path.bin, not image_path.json.
RATIONALE: Binary format requires .bin extension. Current behavior may be creating .json files.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-007
TITLE: Data Merge Functionality
STATEMENT: The save_data() method SHALL support merging new data with existing sidecar data if a sidecar already exists for the image. The merged data SHALL preserve all operation types (e.g., face_detection, yolov8) in a single sidecar file.
RATIONALE: Sportball saves both face detection and object detection results to the same sidecar file. The Rust implementation must support this multi-operation storage pattern.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-008
TITLE: Operation Type Enum Support
STATEMENT: The Python bindings SHALL expose OperationType enum with values for FACE_DETECTION, OBJECT_DETECTION, YOLOV8, BALL_DETECTION, QUALITY_ASSESSMENT, GAME_DETECTION, and UNIFIED.
RATIONALE: Sportball uses these operation types to categorize detection results within sidecar files.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-009
TITLE: Python API Compatibility
STATEMENT: The Python bindings create_sidecar() method SHALL be compatible with the expected usage pattern from sportball/sidecar.py where sidecar data is provided as a nested dictionary structure with operation_type keys (e.g., {"face_detection": {...}, "yolov8": {...}}).
RATIONALE: Sportball saves unified detection results with multiple operation types in a single sidecar file.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-010
TITLE: Read Existing Sidecar Format Detection
STATEMENT: The Rust implementation SHALL automatically detect and read existing sidecar files in any format (.bin, .rkyv, or .json) when loading sidecar data for merging. The read_data() method SHALL support reading legacy JSON files for backward compatibility.
RATIONALE: Existing sidecars may be in JSON format from prior runs. The system must seamlessly handle mixed formats during migration period.
PRIORITY: High
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-011
TITLE: Sidecar Metadata Preservation
STATEMENT: The sidecar SHALL preserve and update metadata fields including sidecar_info with created_at, last_updated, last_operation, image_path, symlink_path, and symlink_info structures.
RATIONALE: Sportball relies on this metadata structure for sidecar management and symlink resolution.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-012
TITLE: Performance Requirements
STATEMENT: Binary format serialization SHALL achieve at least 50% size reduction compared to equivalent JSON and 3-10x performance improvement in read/write operations.
RATIONALE: Binary format adoption is justified by these performance improvements over JSON format.
PRIORITY: High
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-013
TITLE: Error Handling
STATEMENT: ALL errors during sidecar operations SHALL be properly propagated to Python layer with descriptive error messages. Rust panics SHALL be caught and converted to Python exceptions.
RATIONALE: Proper error handling enables Python code to handle failures gracefully and provide user feedback.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-014
TITLE: Thread Safety
STATEMENT: The Rust implementation SHALL be thread-safe for concurrent sidecar operations from multiple Python threads.
RATIONALE: Sportball performs parallel detection operations that may attempt concurrent sidecar writes.
PRIORITY: High
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-015
TITLE: Python Bindings Integration Test
STATEMENT: The implementation SHALL include Python integration tests that verify save_data() or create_sidecar() properly creates .bin files, that data can be read back correctly, and that merging preserves all operation types.
RATIONALE: Integration tests ensure the Python bindings work as expected by the sportball application.
PRIORITY: High
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-016
TITLE: Automatic Format Migration
STATEMENT: The Rust implementation SHALL provide capability to convert existing JSON sidecar files to binary format (.bin) when read for the first time. The original JSON file SHALL be preserved until explicitly deleted.
RATIONALE: Enables gradual migration from JSON to binary format without breaking existing workflows.
PRIORITY: Medium
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-017
TITLE: Sidecar File Discovery
STATEMENT: The implementation SHALL provide a find_sidecars() method that discovers all sidecar files in a directory, supporting both .bin and .json formats, with optional operation type filtering.
RATIONALE: Sportball needs to discover and process multiple sidecar files for statistics and validation operations.
PRIORITY: High
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: RUST-018
TITLE: Nested Backend Support
STATEMENT: The save_data() and read_data() methods SHALL support nested backend storage within operation types (e.g., face_detection -> {insightface: {...}, face_recognition: {...}}).
RATIONALE: Sportball may use multiple detection backends for the same operation type and needs to store results from all backends.
PRIORITY: High
STATUS: Pending
