[REQUIREMENT]
UID: BINARY-FR-000
TITLE: Compiled Tool Priority Policy
STATEMENT: If a Rust or other compiled tool (C, Go, etc.) is available for any operation, the Python interface to that compiled tool SHALL ALWAYS be used over any "Python fallback" implementation. Sidecar files SHALL only be managed with the sidecar manager (image-sidecar-rust). There SHALL be NO manipulation, editing, appending, etc. within Python code. All sidecar operations SHALL be done in Rust. If Rust is inadequate, the Rust project SHALL be fixed - do NOT create a lesser quality and slower Python implementation.
RATIONALE: Compiled tools provide superior performance, reliability, and maintainability. Python fallbacks create inferior solutions and technical debt. All sidecar operations MUST go through the compiled Rust tool to maintain quality standards.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: BINARY-FR-001
TITLE: Binary Sidecar Format Support
STATEMENT: The system shall support binary sidecar file formats (.bin and .rkyv) in addition to JSON format, providing superior performance and storage efficiency. ALL sidecar file operations SHALL be managed by the Rust sidecar manager (image-sidecar-rust). Python code SHALL NOT manipulate sidecar files directly.
RATIONALE: Binary formats provide 50-70% size reduction and 3-10x faster read/write performance compared to JSON, addressing performance bottlenecks in large photo collections. All operations must go through the compiled Rust tool to maintain performance benefits and consistency.
PRIORITY: Critical

STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: BINARY-TR-007.4
TITLE: Remove _save_with_python Method
STATEMENT: The _save_with_python method in Sidecar class SHALL be removed. All sidecar save operations SHALL use the image-sidecar-rust module exclusively.
RATIONALE: Removing _save_with_python eliminates the Python fallback path and ensures consistent Rust-backed operations.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: BINARY-TR-007.5
TITLE: Remove Fallback Logic from save_data_merge
STATEMENT: The save_data_merge method SHALL only use Rust backend and SHALL raise exceptions if Rust is unavailable.
RATIONALE: Eliminating fallback logic ensures exclusive use of the Rust implementation and prevents Python fallback execution.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: BINARY-TR-008
TITLE: Exclusive image-sidecar-rust Module Usage
STATEMENT: ALL sidecar manipulation operations SHALL use the image-sidecar-rust module. No direct file I/O or serialization SHALL occur outside of the Rust module.
RATIONALE: Exclusive use of the image-sidecar-rust module ensures consistent binary format usage, high performance, and eliminates format inconsistencies.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: BINARY-TR-008.1
TITLE: No Direct JSON Serialization
STATEMENT: The system SHALL NOT perform direct json.dump() or json.load() operations for sidecar data. All serialization SHALL be handled by the image-sidecar-rust module.
RATIONALE: Eliminating direct JSON serialization ensures exclusive use of binary format through the Rust module and prevents format inconsistencies.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: BINARY-TR-008.2
TITLE: No Direct File I/O
STATEMENT: The system SHALL NOT perform direct file I/O operations for sidecar files. All file operations SHALL be handled by the image-sidecar-rust module.
RATIONALE: Delegating file operations to the Rust module ensures proper format handling and maintains consistency across all sidecar operations.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: BINARY-TR-008.3
TITLE: Exclusive Rust Module Delegation
STATEMENT: All sidecar read, write, and management operations SHALL delegate exclusively to the image-sidecar-rust module methods.
RATIONALE: Exclusive Rust delegation ensures consistent behavior, high performance, and eliminates Python fallback code paths.
PRIORITY: Critical
STATUS: Pending
